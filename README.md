# Understanding the meaning of a sentence according to its intonation

There are sentences that have several meanings, depending on how the sentence is said, Which word is stressed.

For example:
The sentence "I did not still the bag from you" can be interpreted in several ways, depending on the word that the speaker emphasizes (underlined):

1. "I did not  *still the bag from you" - I did not steal the bag, I may have taken or asked.
The emphasis is on the act of stealing, which the speaker wants to deny.

2. "I did not still the *bag from you" - I did not steal the bag, it is possible that I stole something else from you. The emphasis is on the stolen object, the speaker wants to deny that the stolen object is a bag.

3. "I did not still the bag from *you" - I did not steal from you. The negation is about who the bag was stolen from. The speaker wants to rule out that the bag was stolen from you (it may have been stolen by me, from someone else).

Humans distinguish between the change in meaning naturally, but it is difficult to point to a certain legality that determines the difference.

This project deals with building a model based on deep learning, which provides an interpretation of the meaning of a sentence according to the intonation of the speaker - the way in which the sentence is said, such as emphasis on certain words, voice pitch and the emotion in which the sentence is said (sarcasm, anger, etc.).

Language processing research is a field that has gained momentum in recent years, the goal of which is to help computers "understand" things that are said or typed in human natural language.

Understanding the meaning of the sentence is a milestone in many areas, such as identifying a person in distress by their voice, maintaining the quality of customer service by processing the recordings with them, converting audio to text with punctuation marks, developing a bot system and more.

### Description of the solution at a glance:

input: speech - on it we would like to carry out the process of understanding its meaning,
        And several other recordings of the same speaker.
Output: Analysis of the sentence meaning of the first audio
